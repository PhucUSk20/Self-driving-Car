# SMART ROBOT WAREHOUSE
An autonomous robot for warehouse automation, integrating deep learning, computer vision, and IoT. The system enables route setup through QR Code scanning and MQTT communication, followed by autonomous navigation and area recognition. For obstacle avoidance, the robot automatically stops when detecting obstacles and triggers FCM notifications, while also being trained to maneuver around them. Remote monitoring and control are facilitated via a Flask-based website and mobile app.
